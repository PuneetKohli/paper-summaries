## [MSR-net:Low-light Image Enhancement Using Deep Convolutional Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02488)

1. Problem: Images captured in low light have very low contrast.
2. Enhancing image using CNN model and **Retinex theory**.
3. Traditional approaches for this problem:
    * Histogram based methods
    * Retinex Based methods
4. This paper introduces a model combining CNN and Retinex theory to solve low-light image enhancement challenge.
5. Regard it as a supervised learning problem
